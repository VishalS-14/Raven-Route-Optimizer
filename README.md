## 📌 Overview
Raven AI Route Optimizer is an AI-assisted geospatial routing system designed to compute efficient, reliable, and preference-aware travel routes. The project integrates graph-based pathfinding algorithms with interactive map visualization to deliver optimized and alternative routes.

The system focuses on intelligent decision-making by combining classical routing algorithms with modern web technologies, making route planning more transparent and adaptable.

## 🏗️ Architecture
The project follows a modular client–server architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability:

- **Frontend Layer**
  - React-based UI for user interaction
  - Leaflet-powered interactive map visualization
  - Dynamic rendering of optimal and alternative routes

- **Routing & Logic Layer**
  - Graph-based pathfinding algorithms
  - Preference-aware route scoring and filtering
  - API-driven data exchange

- **Data & Mapping Layer**
  - OpenStreetMap (OSM) for geospatial data
  - Coordinate-based node and edge representation
